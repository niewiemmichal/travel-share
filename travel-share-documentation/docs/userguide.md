Sometimes in order to grow up you and your friends need to grow apart... Even though
it may be harsh at the beginning you will have to make some cleaning in your social
media. TravelShare is no different! You can delete your ex-friend from list to forget

so you can demand quid back! Simply go to all your friends and hit the trash button
